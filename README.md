# Ozone levels prediction with Bayesian methods

Our goal was to build a Bayesian model for predicting ozone levels of seven weather
stations located in Slovenia at 8 oâ€™clock. We have about five years worth of data for all
stations. Each data point includes many relevant features like past ozone measurements,
meteorological measurements (e.g. temperature, wind) and meteorological predictions
from an existing model (ECMWF).
